      <h3>What is Join?</h3>
      <p>
        <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> is a kanban-based project
        management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        <br /><br />
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> leverages
        the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
        in an intuitive, visual interface. <br /><br />

        It is important to note that <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> is
        designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
        business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
        experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Exploring the Board</b> <br />
          When you log in to <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>, you'll find
          a default board. This board represents your project and contains four
          default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Creating Contacts</b> <br />
          In <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>, you can add contacts to
          collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
          "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
          contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
          the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Adding Cards</b> <br />
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
          represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
          list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
          task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Moving Cards</b> <br />
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
          the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Deleting Cards</b> <br />
          Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
          delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
          Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
          irreversible. Remember that using
          <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> effectively requires consistent
          updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
          current state of your project. Have more questions about
          <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>? Feel free to contact us at
          [Your Contact Email]. We're here to help you!
